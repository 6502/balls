# balls
A small html/javascript game

A very famous puzzle: you can pop an group of connected balls
of the same color (minimum is two) and after that all the other
balls just fall down if the square below is available.

The more balls you pop with a single move the better as score is not
linear

What is the highest score you can reach?
